#  CUDA Particle Filter – GPU Capstone Project

##  Overview

This project implements a **CUDA-accelerated Particle Filter** for real-time state estimation and tracking.
The objective is to demonstrate how GPU parallelism significantly improves performance by processing thousands of particles simultaneously.

All major stages of the particle filter run on the GPU:

* Initialization
* Propagation
* Weight update
* Normalization
* Resampling

This project was developed as part of the **GPU Specialization Capstone**.

##  Algorithm Summary

A **particle filter** estimates the state of a system using many random samples called particles.

Each iteration performs:

1. **Propagation**
   Updates each particle using a motion model.

2. **Update**
   Computes how well each particle matches the measurement.

3. **Normalization**
   Scales all weights so their sum equals 1.

4. **Resampling**
   Generates a new particle set based on weight distribution.

GPU parallelism assigns **one thread per particle**, enabling massive speedup over CPU implementations.
